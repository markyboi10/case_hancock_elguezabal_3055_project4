/**
* Class: CSC1610-B Problem Solving with Java <br />
* Instructor: Noonan, Mary G <br />
* Description: Programming Project 2 or RockPaperScissors is a basic program that randomly generates between three numbers (0,1,and 2) and matches them with rock, paper, or scissors.
* The user will start the game and play against the computer. At the end, the computer will output the results/winner.<br />
* Due: 10/1/2020 </ br>
* I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently. <br />
I have not copied the code from a student or any source. <br />
I have not given my code to any student. <br />
